  "body": "# Hedging-with-minimax. #\r\n##Alexandra Rouhana's Final Year Project##\r\n\r\n\r\n###what's the story ?###\r\nThe main objective of this project was to implement a minimax algorithm mimicking the Black-Scholes hedging strategy.\r\n A game between the Investor and the Market was simulated. \r\n This game has been divided into multiple trading periods during which  both players select in turn their future actions from a predefined set. For the Investor, finding the best move essentially comes to minimize his losses knowing that the adversary, the Market will want to maximize them. \r\n \r\n \r\n###What are the different files included in the repository?###\r\n* The file \"minimax\" contains the main code running the algorithm.\r\n* The file \"parameters\" needs to be included in the same folder as the minimax code.\r\n* The file \"bs_closed_form\" contains an implementation of the BS equations for EC options.\r\n* The file \"bs_closed_implied vol\" contains an implementation of the Newton Algorithm to compute the implied volatility. \r\n\r\n ### How to run the code?###\r\n To run this code you will need: \r\n  * Python 2.7\r\n  * The Python libraries numpy and scipy\r\n             \r\n",
