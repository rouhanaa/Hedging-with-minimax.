<p>The main objective of this project was to implement a minimax algorithm mimicking the Black-Scholes hedging strategy.
 A game between the Investor and the Market was simulated. 
 This game has been divided into multiple trading periods during which  both players select in turn their future actions from a predefined set. For the Investor, finding the best move essentially comes to minimize his losses knowing that the adversary, the Market will want to maximize them. </p>

<ul>
<li>The file "minimax" contains the main code running the algorithm.</li>
<li>The file "parameters" needs to be included in the same folder as the minimax code.</li>
<li>The file "bs_closed_form" contains an implementation of the BS equations for EC options.</li>
<li>
<p>The file "bs_closed_implied vol" contains an implementation of the Newton Algorithm to compute the implied volatility. </p>
